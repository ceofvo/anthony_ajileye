            <p>Project Management simply put is everything required to ensure the successful delivery of a project from conception to completion.</p>
            <p>Many at times use the phrase “project management” loosely but it is much more than the physical delivery phase only. For some in property, real estate, construction or engineering, it is often assumed that construction management is same as project management but this is an inaccurate assumption. In fact, construction management is just one of the elements of project management. The wider perspective of project management includes but not limited to, risk management, development of business cases, earned value management, project controls, change control, construction management, project finance, commercial reviews, engineering management, HSEQ, procurements, project cost analysis, benefit realisation, post handover processes amongst several others.</p>
            <p>The first point of call for any wise Investor on any Project is to engage a professional and competent Project Manager. By so doing, you will get independent, competent and professional guidance throughout the Project Life Cycle from conception to completion.</p>
            <p>You will get the help you need in procurement (selection of right Contractors, Designers, Architects etc.), through to planning the works, challenging the designs from buildability and safety perspective for the holistic life of the structure, monitoring implementation which includes acceptable approach in compliance with regulatory standards and professional handover culminating in adequate documentation to serve as a reference for the end users.</p>
            <p>Not exploring the right approach will cost you more in the long run and you may end up not getting the optimum benefit from your investment. Cutting corners can be a disaster. Only the competent Project Manager has the holistic knowledge of all Stakeholders contributing to the overall success of a Project.</p>
