            <h3>Idowu Anthony-Ajileye</h3>
            <p>Absorbed words transform minds if professionally and convincingly presented in the right atmosphere. We don't know what we don't know until it is brought to our attention. Even when our consciousness is triggered with knowledge, the way it is received is a measure of how it is communicated. The power of words cannot be overemphasised as it can be deeply transforming if we choose to act accordingly. Hence the saying, “applied knowledge is power”</p>
