                    <p>It was my pleasure to have worked with Idowu during his amazing delivery to a Project Management and Construction training course to a participant from Oman. His presentation skills and ability to manage business are exceptional. I believe he is able to portray his deep knowledge and experience into a presentation that one would find very easy to comprehend. He is great to work with.</p>

                    <p>I had occasion to ask Anthony's advice recently regarding a marketing challenge. I was seeking guidance on how best to market my "job market training" to parents who might be concerned about the career prospects of their youngsters. Even over the phone, Anthony was extremely helpful, offering useful tips as to how I might go about this and, just as important, things I should avoid doing.</p>

                    <p>Anthony attended my Presentation Skills programme in 2013. He is a highly dynamic individual who easily leaves a lasting and positive impression of himself. He domonstrated a high level of proficiency in his personal presentation skills right from the off. He was one of the most enthusiastic and dedicated attendees I have seen and I can fully recommend him both for his excellent presentation abilities, his leadership qualities, and his huge enthusiasm to learn and develop.</p>

                    <p>Idowu Anthony-Ajileye gives sound guidance to those who wish to advance their professional careers. In the TEDx Imperial College Presentation titled: "Think Outside The Box and Pay The Price", Mr Idowu Anthony-Ajileye presents a systematic approach to the development of a professional career after the stages of institutional education/training. He has laid out this road-map in clear simple terms, illustrated with candid anecdotes of personal experiences. This is a succinct practical guide to getting a successful career kick-started, which should apply anywhere in the world. The cherry on the cake is the subtle reference to the fact that, development of individual professional careers are building blocks to the foundation of a successful society.</p>
